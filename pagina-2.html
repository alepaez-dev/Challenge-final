                                <p>
                                    You may think a career is an old fashioned concept out of the 80s which could be safely ignored. I sure used to… I thought a career was for banking professionals in suits, not for me! I was young and cool and wanted to work for a living, of course, but I couldn't care less about climbing up the career ladder. Well, I changed my mind.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I'm not saying that a career should be everyone's focus at every point in one's life. Just having a job is a totally legit choice. But if you want to to have a career, in the sense of progressing throughout your work life, expanding your horizons and opportunities for personal and professional impact, here's a list of 8 things to avoid doing. 
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <!-- 1 -->
                            <div class="info-article">
                                <h2>
                                    1. Don't plan ahead
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    It's easy to just flow with opportunities that present themselves, go on a few interviews, take the best offer you get, stay for a few years, rinse, repeat. That will probably work for getting small raises and some variety in your daily work.
                                </p>
                                <img class="imagenes-pag-2" src="assets/pagina-2-imagen-1.jpg" alt="">

                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    But if you want a career you should have a short, mid and long term plan (2, 5, 10 years ahead) and be intentional about reaching goals that will advance you in the right direction. Imagine what you want to be "when you grow up", give yourself room to experiment and try different things in order to achieve that long term vision, but always keep your eyes on the ball. Remember that you can always change your plans according to your shifting wants and needs, but if you don't have one at all it's unlikely you will be very effective in getting much of anywhere.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sometimes "leaning out" is perfectly fine, if you want to focus on other things besides work for a while, but it's important to be intentional about it. Otherwise you'll find yourself looking back and seeing wasted time instead of time well spent doing other things. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Whichever path you choose, put your 2, 5, 10 years plan in writing so you can reflect on it every year or so and adjust your plan or your goals according to the progress you made or what's going on in your life. 
                                </p>

                                        Once, not so long ago, I set a 7 year goal and ended up achieving it in less than 2 years. That was fun, exciting and encouraging and I could set my sights on the next goal!

                                <p>
                                    This is a common misconception -- we assume that if we do good work we'll get recognized and promoted for it. It makes sense on the surface, right? Our work will speak for us, we shouldn't have to broadcast it, it's self-evident.
                                </p>

                                    Unfortunately, that's not how things work. Assuming that (hopefully) competence is a prerequisite for promotion, and even under the best of performance review systems, you'll still have to help your manager see what you've achieved. In fact, sometimes our best work is utterly invisible -- if the project you worked on succeeded without any major outages or errors, it might be less visible and therefore less appreciated than a project with major setbacks and failures which created a lot of "noise".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Try to get comfortable telling people about your successes. Even sharing failures and how you overcame them is a powerful message. If you find this hard to do, try to craft your messages in a way that benefit your readers/listeners -- frame it as a "lesson learned" or as a team success story (without giving all the credit to the team). You won't look like you're bragging, but will get the visibility you need.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you can't manage that, please try again. But if you just can't bring yourself to do it -- another useful strategy is to form a group of allies who praise each other in public settings. You may think it's obvious what you're doing, but it's not, people won't notice. And if they do -- who cares, your message is out anyway.
                                </p>

                                        I recommend keeping a weekly log of things you did at work, good or bad. I've been doing it for a while and it helps me keep a semi-objective record of what I've achieved and all the data points I need for my self-review and 1:1 conversations with my manager. I also use it for sprint retros, highlights/lowlights of work with other team members for their 360 reviews etc. There's no way I would be able to remember enough to give quality feedback for myself or others without it.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    On top of the effort to make your work visible, remember to ask for what you want. Even the best of managers might not be aware you're interested in. Others might find it easier to only react only when specifically asked or faced with an ultimatum. Don't let them get away with that. Tell whoever's willing to listen that you want a promotion or a raise. Share with your manager that you feel you'd like some recognition. If you don't get what you asked for -- at least you'll know you've done your best (and maybe it's time to move on to a manager who will recognize your worth).
                                </p>

                                    Sometimes you'll look at your colleagues and think they're just so much smarter than you or something about their circumstances enables them to work harder, longer hours or with less interruptions (e.g. if you have kids and they don't). There's no way you can win against them, they'll always be more successful than you, so what's the point of trying?
                                </p>

                                        I fell into this kind of thinking after having kids. I wanted to spend time with them and I figured I couldn't "win" over single or childless colleagues, so I should just "give up". I didn't think of it that way exactly, but for the most part -- that's what I did in practice.
                                    </p>

                                    I'm not going to sugar-coat this: yes, you probably can't "win". There will always be people who are smarter than you and have more time, less responsibilities, more ambition… But a career is not a zero-sum game. Just because other people will advance faster than you at a certain times in your/their life, doesn't mean you can't advance at all. Don't give up, adjust your expectations to what you can achieve and don't compare yourself to others (too much…), it will probably just discourage you. In the long term it won't matter if you got a promotion a year or two later. However, it might make a huge difference if you wait 10 years because you think someone else's success prevent you from achieving anything yourself.

                                    Here's a story: 
                                </p>
                                <div class="parrafo-izq-border">
                                    <p class="ml-3">
                                        I worked mostly alone for 6 years, with a few freelance developers and an architect helping me. I had to do everything myself, including product work. After a few years the company was sold to a larger company, and I decided it was time to move on.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    Here's another story: 
                                </p>
                                <div class="parrafo-izq-border">
                                    <p class="ml-3">
                                        For 6 years I lead the development of a successful product, enlisting the help of freelance developers and consulting with a software architect I worked closely with. I worked directly with senior staff, provided valuable product input and coordinated the design work. Partly due to the excellent technical quality of the product, the company was sold to a giant European corporation. I felt I had spent my time there well, but it was time to move on to new challenges.
                                    </p>

                                    Both of these stories are (my) true stories. But the first one is underselling what I actually did. It's the story of a passive lone wolf (which I am not). The second one is the better version, highlighting my strengths and impact. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In my experience mentoring, I've found many who take the first approach when constructing their story (I know I've made this mistake). They just don't understand how it sounds. 
                                </p>

                                    Don't underestimate the impact of constructing a powerful narrative. If you're job searching, get a few people to listen to your 3–5 minute "tell me about yourself" pitch and listen to their feedback about how you come across. Same for the "who am I and what am I looking for" section of your CV or cover letter.

                                    In fact, it's best if you do the same for all the "soft" part of the interviewing process. The same series of events can be told in a way that portrays you as resentful or as proactive, as a failure or as a person who learns from their mistakes. You should take the time to prepare for soft skills interviews by writing down your stories and bouncing them off listeners, rewriting them to convey the best version of yourself. Remember, this isn't about bending the truth, it's about building your narrative in a way that serves you well.

                                    If you're not searching for a job right now, it's still worth while to think about your story and how it fits in to your self image and long term goals. Maybe you don't appreciate yourself enough and that's holding you back.
