                                <p>
                                    You may think a career is an old fashioned concept out of the 80s which could be safely ignored. I sure used to… I thought a career was for banking professionals in suits, not for me! I was young and cool and wanted to work for a living, of course, but I couldn't care less about climbing up the career ladder. Well, I changed my mind.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I'm not saying that a career should be everyone's focus at every point in one's life. Just having a job is a totally legit choice. But if you want to to have a career, in the sense of progressing throughout your work life, expanding your horizons and opportunities for personal and professional impact, here's a list of 8 things to avoid doing. 
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <!-- 1 -->
                            <div class="info-article">
                                <h2>
                                    1. Don't plan ahead
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    It's easy to just flow with opportunities that present themselves, go on a few interviews, take the best offer you get, stay for a few years, rinse, repeat. That will probably work for getting small raises and some variety in your daily work.
                                </p>

                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    But if you want a career you should have a short, mid and long term plan (2, 5, 10 years ahead) and be intentional about reaching goals that will advance you in the right direction. Imagine what you want to be "when you grow up", give yourself room to experiment and try different things in order to achieve that long term vision, but always keep your eyes on the ball. Remember that you can always change your plans according to your shifting wants and needs, but if you don't have one at all it's unlikely you will be very effective in getting much of anywhere.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sometimes "leaning out" is perfectly fine, if you want to focus on other things besides work for a while, but it's important to be intentional about it. Otherwise you'll find yourself looking back and seeing wasted time instead of time well spent doing other things. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Whichever path you choose, put your 2, 5, 10 years plan in writing so you can reflect on it every year or so and adjust your plan or your goals according to the progress you made or what's going on in your life. 
                                </p>

                                        Once, not so long ago, I set a 7 year goal and ended up achieving it in less than 2 years. That was fun, exciting and encouraging and I could set my sights on the next goal!
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                    1. Do the work and wait for recognition to come
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    This is a common misconception -- we assume that if we do good work we'll get recognized and promoted for it. It makes sense on the surface, right? Our work will speak for us, we shouldn't have to broadcast it, it's self-evident.
                                </p>

                                    Unfortunately, that's not how things work. Assuming that (hopefully) competence is a prerequisite for promotion, and even under the best of performance review systems, you'll still have to help your manager see what you've achieved. In fact, sometimes our best work is utterly invisible -- if the project you worked on succeeded without any major outages or errors, it might be less visible and therefore less appreciated than a project with major setbacks and failures which created a lot of "noise".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Try to get comfortable telling people about your successes. Even sharing failures and how you overcame them is a powerful message. If you find this hard to do, try to craft your messages in a way that benefit your readers/listeners -- frame it as a "lesson learned" or as a team success story (without giving all the credit to the team). You won't look like you're bragging, but will get the visibility you need.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you can't manage that, please try again. But if you just can't bring yourself to do it -- another useful strategy is to form a group of allies who praise each other in public settings. You may think it's obvious what you're doing, but it's not, people won't notice. And if they do -- who cares, your message is out anyway.
                                </p>
                                <div class="parrafo-izq-border">

                                        I recommend keeping a weekly log of things you did at work, good or bad. I've been doing it for a while and it helps me keep a semi-objective record of what I've achieved and all the data points I need for my self-review and 1:1 conversations with my manager. I also use it for sprint retros, highlights/lowlights of work with other team members for their 360 reviews etc. There's no way I would be able to remember enough to give quality feedback for myself or others without it.
